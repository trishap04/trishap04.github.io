### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1, was a favorite because I always look forward to my birthday, even when it’s far away. With this code, we were able to calculate the difference in dates to find the number of days between any two dates, no matter how far away from each other they were. It also posed a nice challenge because the formulas and expressions were long for this lab. We had to use Fliegel & Van Flandern’s algorithms to convert two dates to Julian Days and then proceed to find the difference between the two with only the use of int. Even though I went through and had so many errors, it was a great relief to see “format passing” with a smiley face. Lastly, I found researching Julian Days exciting and how they’re different from regular dates. Converting them was a fun challenge. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, I enjoyed all of the parts of this lab because they were fun little topics and activities like Blackjack and sandwich order. Even though this was a smaller lab, it was more enjoyable because of the topics. I enjoyed part 1 extra because it connected to another math class I’m in where the order of how you put things on a sandwich changes and how many different ways you can do that. It was a fun mad lib program where we could fill in the blanks of a sandwich order using command line arguments.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was my favorite because I love playing Blackjack in the real world. Seeing how the game plays out on the computer was something I found very intriguing. Being able to create functions to find the right hand for Blackjack despite not knowing how the Aces or face cards are given out was what I found very fun. Similar to lab 5, we use command line arguments. Lastly, I liked to test the code extra on this part of the lab because you could do a wide variety of different tests to see what score you would get. The specifics and array of options in this lab, such as using IsAce, IsFaceCard, and IsNumberCard, gave a real challenge but made creating the program for a fun game even more enjoyable.
